I'm a lonely person, but that's not the case.

i might fall, i might trip but i don't mind this.

if that's what it brings me, so let it be it.

i might not find joy, but i'll surely find love.

For people that seek happiness
Don't give up on hope because there is no light, even if you only can see an endless void every place in the world has a spark of light, the spark of hope.
It will make you understand the worth of feeling love and being treasured by someone you never ever seen.\
That's how i am a hopeless human being that only sees a dark void but is grasping around just to find that little spark of light that has appeared in the darkness surrounding me.
