For people that seek happiness
Don't give up on hope because there is no light, even if you only can see an endless void every place in the world has a spark of light, the spark of hope.
It will make you understand the worth of feeling love and being treasured by someone you never ever seen.\
That's how i am a hopeless human being that only sees a dark void but is grasping around just to find that little spark of light that has appeared in the darkness surrounding me.
